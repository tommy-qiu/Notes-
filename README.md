# Notes!
A Note-Taking Application

This notes application was built using Storyboards and Swift Files. Storyboard Objects were used and Cocoa Touch Files
were made for the Table View Controller and the View Controller which made up the Storyboard file. IBActions and IBOutlets
were used to connect buttons and text fields to the code. CoreData and CoreData entities were used to store the notes locally 
so that the notes could be saved even if the application was completely stopped, so these notes could be retrieved from memory easily.
