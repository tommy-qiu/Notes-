## Description

#### What is this project?
The Notes! project allows you to create notes, name these notes with a title, use the first line of the note as a description, save these notes so that when you close the application they are still there and finally delete notes.

#### How does it work?

#### How was it made?
This application was built using Storyboards and Swift Files. Storyboard Objects were used and Cocoa Touch Files
were made for the Table View Controller and the View Controller which made up the Storyboard file. IBActions and IBOutlets
were used to connect buttons and text fields to the code. CoreData and CoreData entities were used to store the notes locally 
so that the notes could be saved even if the application was completely stopped, so these notes could be retrieved from memory easily.
