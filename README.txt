This was a project to practice iOS development. 

What was used

Notes! uses Storyboards with Segues and unwind Segues to move between Table View Controller and View Controller. The storyboard objects were used often to reduce the amount of code that was written pragmatically. In addition, the notes are saved locally using CoreData and CoreDataEntities.
